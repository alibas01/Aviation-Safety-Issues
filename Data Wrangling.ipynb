       "7    SOME TIME HAD PASSED AFTER WE HAD PASSED THE RZS VOR INBND TO SBP. I USED MY FAMILIARIZATION WITH THE AREA'S GND LIGHTING TO DETERMINE THAT WE WERE APCHING THE SMX-SBP AREA. ALSO; I DETERMINED THAT DUE TO OUR CLOSE PROX TO THE AREA THAT WE NEEDED TO START A DES RATHER QUICKLY. OTHERWISE; WE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET THE LTT'S DES LIMITATION OF A MAX 1000 FPM RATE OF DES AND STILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A REASONABLE SPD TO THE ARPT. I ASKED ATC FOR A LOWER ALT AND WAS ASSIGNED TO 7000'. IN MY OPINION THIS ALT WAS STILL TOO HIGH TO MEET THE LTT'S LIMITATION SO I STARTED LOOKING FOR THE ARPT IN ORDER TO BE ASSIGNED A VISUAL APCH AND UNRESTRICTED LOWER ALT. WHEN APCHING THE SMX-SBP AREA FROM THE S; SBP IS THE LAST CLUSTER OF LIGHTS SIGHTED BEFORE CONTINUING TO THE N. BOTH THE F/O AND I SIGHTED AN ARPT BEACON IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE LAST CLUSTER OF LIGHTS. WE BOTH ASSUMED THIS TO BE SBP SO I CALLED THE ARPT IN SIGHT TO ATC.
