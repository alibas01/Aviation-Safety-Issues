# Aviation-Safety-Model
Aerospace is the one of the biggest industries in the world. Passengers safety perception is extremely effective on the investment’s fate. In order to protect the customers’ health and comfort, and the companies’ investments, flight safety is always priority in the market.

The ***Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS)*** database is the world's largest repository of voluntary, confidential safety information provided by aviation's frontline personnel, including pilots, controllers, mechanics, flight attendants, and dispatchers. The database provides a foundation for specific products and subsequent research addressing a variety of aviation safety issues. I downloaded a data with approximately 200.000 observations in 100 columns

Here is my NLP model on this data set after going through data cleaning, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis and some unique data visualization features.

My ML model is providing a good representation of the reasons on air conflicts in a variety of classification by using crew's narratives.
Accuracy Scores for the Training set : 0.83854 and Test Set : 0.821946
